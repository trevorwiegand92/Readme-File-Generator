Finished homework assignment for week nine. Creating a professional readme generator.

NAME: Readme File Generator

The objective of this assignment was to create a quality README using a command-line application to generate one for the user, allowing more devotion to the creator to work on the project. 

The command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application is invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Table of Contents

    * [Installation](#Installation)

    * [Usage](#Usage)

    * [License](#License)

    * [Contributing](#Contributions)
    
    * [Tests](#Tests)
